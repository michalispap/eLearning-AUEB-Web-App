# eLearning-AUEB-Web-App
A web application that allows the user to search the courses provided by AUEB's eLearning program based on a keyword. Course categories are also available, so that the user can explore the content based on his/her interests. In addition, the website contains a registration functionality, where the user can sign up and later sign in to view his/her profile information.
The tools used to implement this project were HTML, CSS, JavaScipt, Handlebars, Node.js platform and the Express.js framework.
